**Course Contents:** <br>
The goal of the course is to acquaint students with the basic Machine Learning concepts and algorithms. Specifically, the course will cover parametric and non-parametric density estimation, linear and non-linear classification, unsupervised learning including clustering and dimensionality reduction, performance evaluation of predictive algorithms, ethical issues in machine learning.

**Study Goals:** <br>
After succesfully completing this course, the student is able to:
- explain the basic concepts and algorithms of machine learning and underlying statistical concepts.
- implement, apply and evaluate ML algorithms in Python
- explain the concept of and identify (implicit) bias in data and ML algorithms
