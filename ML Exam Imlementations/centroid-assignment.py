# During this assignment youâ€™re going to implement a part of the k means clustering algorithm.
# To be able to update the centroids of the clusters in the future, we need to know which points of the dataset belong to which centroid.
#
# Given are points (np.array) and centroids (np.array), implement a function that returns a list,
# that contains for each data point the index to its closest centroid. Use the euclidean distance for the distance computation.
# If it is a tie, your function should return the centroid with the lowest index.
#
# Hint: you can use np.linalg.norm(p1 - p2) to calculate the euclidean distance between two points.
